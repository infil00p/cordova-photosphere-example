# Cordova Photosphere

This is currently just a Photosphere that I was messing around with during PhoneGapDay US 2015.  The images are from
a Ricoh Theta S and the code combines Cordova and Crosswalk to work smoothly on most Android devices.

This photosphere has been tested on the following devices:
* Nexus 5x
* Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge
* HTC One m9
* iPhone 5 (Doesn't look great, but runs smooth.  Please use an iPhone 6 or 6s)
* Moto X (2014)
* Samsung Galaxy S3 (Please don't run it on an S3, it's smooth but the resolution is low and it looks like crap)

The viewers that I've tested this with include:
* Google Cardboard from Google I/O 2015
* Mattel Viewmaster (YMMV, not officially supported by webvr-boilerplate)

Since everything I took from is Apache licenced except three.js, which is MIT, I included the LICENCE and NOTICE files.  If I screwed this
up, please let me know.  The derivative work is licensed Apache as well, and all Photo Spheres are mine.
